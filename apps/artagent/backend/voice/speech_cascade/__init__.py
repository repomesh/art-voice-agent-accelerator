"""
Speech Cascade - Three-Thread STT→LLM→TTS Architecture
=======================================================

Protocol-agnostic speech processing implementing the three-thread architecture
for low-latency voice interactions.

Threads:
    🧵 Thread 1: Speech SDK Thread (Never Blocks)
        - Continuous audio recognition
        - Immediate barge-in detection via on_partial callbacks

    🧵 Thread 2: Route Turn Thread (Blocks on Queue Only)
        - AI processing and response generation
        - Orchestrator delegation for TTS and playback

    🧵 Thread 3: Main Event Loop (Never Blocks)
        - Task cancellation for barge-in scenarios
        - Non-blocking coordination with transport layer

Usage:
    from apps.artagent.backend.voice.speech_cascade import (
        SpeechCascadeHandler,
        SpeechEvent,
        SpeechEventType,
        record_stt_recognition,
    )

Note:
    TTSPlayback is now in apps.artagent.backend.voice.tts (not speech_cascade)
