## :material-account-plus: Step 1: Create a Demo Profile

Before you can have a personalized conversation with the AI agents, you need to create a demo profile. This generates synthetic customer data that agents use for context-aware interactions.

### Create Your Profile

1. **Open the frontend application** at `http://localhost:5173` (or your deployed URL)

2. **Click the profile icon** (👤) in the bottom navigation bar

3. **Click "Create Demo Profile"** to open the profile creation form

4. **Fill in the required fields:**

    | Field | Description | Example |
    |-------|-------------|---------|
    | **Full Name** | Your display name for the demo | `John Smith` |
    | **Email** | **Use your real work email** if testing MFA features | `john.smith@yourcompany.com` |
    | **Phone Number** (optional) | E.164 format for SMS demos | `+14155551234` |
    | **Preferred Channel** | MFA delivery preference | `email` or `sms` |

!!! warning "Important: Use Your Real Email for MFA Testing"
    If you want to test tools that involve multi-factor authentication (like transaction verification), you **must provide your actual email address**. The system will send real 6-digit verification codes to this email that you'll need to read back to the agent during the conversation. This is enabled through Email Communication Services integrated through Azure Communication Services.

5. **Click "Create Profile"** — The system generates:
    - A unique `client_id` for your session
    - Synthetic financial data (account balances, transaction history)
    - Customer intelligence data (communication preferences, relationship history)
    - Demo-safe verification codes

!!! info "Profile Expiration"
    Demo profiles automatically expire after **24 hours** and are purged from the system. All data is synthetic and safe for demos.

### What Gets Generated

Your demo profile includes rich context that agents use for personalized interactions:

!!! example "Sample Demo Profile: john_smith_cfs"
    
    **Institution:** Contoso Financial Services  
    **Relationship Tier:** Platinum  
    **Client Since:** 2019
    
    | Category | Data |
    |----------|------|
    | **Current Balance** | $542,000 |
    | **YTD Transaction Volume** | $8.2M |
    | **Risk Tolerance** | Moderate |
    | **Account Health Score** | 94 |
    
    **Customer Intelligence:**
    
    - Communication Style: Direct/Business-focused
    - Preferred Resolution: Fast, efficient solutions
    - Known Preferences: Quick summaries over detail
    
    **Verification Codes (for demo MFA):**
    
    - SSN Last 4: `7823`
    - Phone Last 4: `1234`  
    - Employee ID: `4521`

---

## :material-robot: Step 2: Create and Configure Agents (Intermediate)

The Agent Builder lets you create custom AI agents directly from the frontend without editing YAML files.

### Open the Agent Builder

1. **Click the robot icon** (🤖) in the bottom navigation bar
2. **The Agent Builder panel** opens on the left side

### Understanding Agent Configuration

| Configuration | Description | Example Values |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Name** | Unique identifier for the agent | `CustomerSupportAgent` |
| **Description** | What this agent specializes in | `Handles billing inquiries` |
| **System Prompt** | Instructions that define agent behavior | `You are a helpful billing specialist...` |
| **Greeting** | First message when agent activates | `Hello! I'm here to help with billing.` |
| **Return Greeting** | Message when returning to this agent | `Welcome back! Where were we?` |
| **Voice** | Neural voice for TTS | `en-US-JennyNeural` |
| **Temperature** | Response creativity (0.0-1.0) | `0.7` |

### Configure Tools

Tools give agents capabilities to take actions. Each agent's tools are defined in their `agent.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example from concierge/agent.yaml
tools:
  - verify_client_identity
  - get_account_summary
  - handoff_card_recommendation
  - handoff_investment_advisor
  - transfer_call_to_call_center
```

| Tool Category | Examples | Use Case |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Account Tools** | `get_account_summary`, `get_recent_transactions` | Financial inquiries |
| **Identity Tools** | `verify_client_identity`, `get_user_profile` | Customer verification |
| **MFA Tools** | `send_verification_code`, `verify_code` | Security verification |
| **Transfer Tools** | `transfer_call_to_call_center` | Live agent escalation |
| **Handoff Tools** | `handoff_fraud_agent`, `handoff_concierge` | Agent-to-agent routing |

!!! info "Handoff Tools vs Scenario Routing"
    While agents declare which handoff tools they can use, the **scenario configuration** determines the actual routing behavior (discrete vs announced) and validates the agent graph.

### Understanding Scenarios

Scenarios define the complete multi-agent orchestration graph. Each scenario specifies:

1. **Which agents are included** in the conversation flow
2. **The starting agent** for the scenario
3. **Handoff routes** — directed edges defining agent-to-agent transfers
4. **Handoff behavior** — `discrete` (silent) or `announced` (target agent greets)

Scenarios are defined in YAML files under `apps/artagent/backend/registries/scenariostore/`:

| Scenario | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `banking` | `banking/orchestration.yaml` | Private banking with card and investment specialists |
| `insurance` | `insurance/scenario.yaml` | Insurance claims with auth and fraud agents |
| `default` | `default/scenario.yaml` | All agents available, announced handoffs |

### Handoff Configuration (Scenario-Level)

Handoffs are now configured at the **scenario level**, not per-agent. Each handoff is a directed edge in the agent graph:

```yaml
# Example from banking/orchestration.yaml
handoffs:
  - from: BankingConcierge
    to: CardRecommendation
    tool: handoff_card_recommendation
    type: discrete            # Silent transition
    share_context: true

  - from: CardRecommendation
    to: BankingConcierge
    tool: handoff_concierge
    type: discrete            # Seamless return
```

**Handoff Types:**

| Type | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| `discrete` | Silent handoff, conversation continues naturally | Same-team specialists, returns |
| `announced` | Target agent greets/announces the transfer | Sensitive topics (fraud), new context |

**Example: Banking Scenario Graph:**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Banking["🏦 Banking Scenario"]
        BC["BankingConcierge"]
        CR["CardRecommendation"]
        IA["InvestmentAdvisor"]
    end
    
    BC -->|"handoff_card_recommendation"| CR
    BC -->|"handoff_investment_advisor"| IA
    CR <-->|"cross-specialist"| IA
    CR -->|"handoff_concierge"| BC
    IA -->|"handoff_concierge"| BC
```

### Configure VAD (Voice Activity Detection)

!!! tip "Selecting a Scenario"
    Scenarios are loaded based on configuration. To switch scenarios:
    
    1. Set the `SCENARIO_NAME` environment variable (e.g., `banking`, `insurance`, `default`)
    2. Or configure via the frontend's scenario selector (if available)
    
    Each scenario defines:
    
    - Which agents are available
    - The starting agent
    - How handoffs behave between agents
    - Shared template variables (company name, industry, etc.)

VAD settings control how the system detects when you're speaking:

| Setting | Description | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Threshold** | Sensitivity to speech (0.0-1.0) | `0.5` (balanced) |
| **Prefix Padding (ms)** | Audio to keep before speech | `300` |
| **Silence Duration (ms)** | Silence before turn ends | `500` |

!!! tip "VAD Tuning Tips"
    - **Noisy environment?** Increase threshold to `0.6-0.7`
    - **Quick responses needed?** Reduce silence duration to `300-400ms`
    - **Agent cutting you off?** Increase silence duration to `600-800ms`

### Voice Configuration

!!! warning "Region-Dependent Voices"
    Available neural voices **depend on your Azure Speech Services region**. Not all voices are available in all regions. An API-based retrieval of available voices will be added in a future release.

Popular voice options:

| Voice | Style | Best For |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `en-US-JennyNeural` | Conversational | General customer service |
| `en-US-SaraNeural` | Friendly | Casual interactions |
| `en-US-GuyNeural` | Professional | Business contexts |
| `en-US-AriaNeural` | Expressive | Dynamic conversations |

---

## :material-microphone: Step 3: Start a Voice Conversation

### Launch the Voice Interface

1. **Click the person icon** (👤) in the bottom navigation to access conversation mode
2. **You'll see two orchestration options:**

### Choose Your Orchestration Mode

The system supports two orchestration modes. Select based on your latency and customization needs:

#### Voice Live (Recommended for Low Latency)

Audio streams directly to OpenAI's Realtime API:

```
🎤 Your Voice  →  OpenAI Realtime API  →  🔊 Audio Response
```

| Metric | Typical Value |
|--------|---------------|
| End-to-end latency | ~200-400ms |
| Barge-in handling | Automatic |
| Audio processing | Server-managed VAD |
| Voice options | OpenAI voices |

**Best for:** Lowest latency requirements, simple demos, when Azure Speech customization isn't needed.

---

#### Cascade (Recommended for Control)

Audio flows through Azure Speech services with separate STT and TTS:

```
🎤 Your Voice  →  Azure STT  →  LLM  →  Azure TTS  →  🔊 Audio
```

| Metric | Typical Value |
|--------|---------------|
| End-to-end latency | ~400-800ms |
| Barge-in handling | Custom VAD |
| Audio processing | Azure Speech SDK |
| Voice options | Azure Neural Voices |

**Best for:** Custom VAD/segmentation control, Azure Neural Voice selection, phrase list customization, fine-grained audio control.

---

!!! tip "Switching Modes"
    Set `ACS_STREAMING_MODE` in your `.env` file:
    
    - `VOICE_LIVE` — Use OpenAI Realtime API
    - `MEDIA` — Use Cascade (Azure Speech)

### Start Speaking

1. **Allow microphone access** when prompted
2. **Wait for the greeting** — the active agent introduces itself
3. **Start your conversation!**

---

## :material-chat-processing: Step 4: Understanding the Conversation Flow

### What to Observe During Conversations

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Input["🎤 You Speak"]
        MIC["Microphone"]
    end
    
    subgraph Processing["⚙️ System Processing"]
        VAD["VAD\nDetection"]
        STT["Speech-to-Text\n(Transcription)"]
        LLM["LLM\nInference"]
        TTS["Text-to-Speech"]
    end
    
    subgraph Output["🔊 Agent Responds"]
        AUDIO["Audio Output"]
    end
    
    MIC --> VAD
    VAD --> STT
    STT --> LLM
    LLM --> TTS
    TTS --> AUDIO
    
    VAD -.->|"Barge-in\nDetection"| TTS
```

### Key Metrics to Watch

| Metric | What It Means | Healthy Range |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **VAD Latency** | Time to detect speech start/stop | < 100ms |
| **STT Latency** | Time to transcribe your speech | < 500ms |
| **LLM TTFT** | Time to first token from LLM | < 300ms |
| **TTS Latency TTFB** | Time to start audio playback | < 200ms |
| **Total Turn Time** | End-to-end response time | < 1.5s |

### Handoff Behavior

When an agent hands off to another agent, behavior depends on the **handoff type** defined in the scenario:

| Handoff Type | Behavior |
|--------------|----------|
| **Announced** | Target agent greets the customer, acknowledging the transfer |
| **Discrete** | Silent handoff — conversation continues naturally without explicit transition |

**Context is always transferred:**

1. **`handoff_context`** — Includes reason, summary, and relevant data
2. **`previous_agent`** — Target agent knows who handed off
3. **`share_context: true`** — Preserves full conversation history (configurable)

**Example: Announced Handoff (Fraud)**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as 👤 You
    participant C as 🎧 Concierge
    participant F as 🔒 FraudAgent
    
    U->>C: "I think someone stole my credit card"
    C->>C: Detects fraud concern
    Note over C,F: type: announced
    C-->>F: Handoff with context
    F->>U: "I'm the fraud specialist. I understand you're concerned about potential unauthorized activity. Let me help you secure your account immediately."
```

**Example: Discrete Handoff (Same-team specialist)**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as 👤 You
    participant BC as 🏦 BankingConcierge
    participant CR as 💳 CardRecommendation
    
    U->>BC: "I want a new credit card"
    BC->>BC: Routes to card specialist
    Note over BC,CR: type: discrete (silent)
    BC-->>CR: Handoff with context
    CR->>U: "I'd be happy to help you find the perfect card. What do you typically spend the most on - travel, dining, or groceries?"
```

### Watch for Anomalies

| Anomaly | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Agent cuts off mid-sentence** | VAD silence too short | Increase `silence_duration_ms` |
| **Long pauses before response** | High LLM latency | Check Azure OpenAI quotas |
| **Echo or feedback** | Microphone picking up speaker | Use headphones |
| **Transcription errors** | Background noise | Adjust VAD threshold |
| **Handoff not triggering** | Missing handoff tool | Check agent tool configuration |
