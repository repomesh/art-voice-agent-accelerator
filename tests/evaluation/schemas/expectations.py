    Expected behavior for a scenario turn (used for validation).

    Supported Attributes
    --------------------
    Tools:
        tools_called: List[str]
            Required tools that MUST be called (recall check).
            Test fails if any are missing.

        tools_optional: List[str]
            Optional tools (won't fail if missing, but won't hurt if called).

        tools_forbidden: List[str]
            Tools that MUST NOT be called (negative test).
            Test fails if any are called.

    Handoffs:
        handoff: Dict[str, str]
            Expected handoff: {"to_agent": "AgentName"}.
            Test fails if handoff doesn't happen to correct agent.

        no_handoff: bool
            If true, asserts NO handoff should occur this turn.

    Response Constraints:
        response_constraints: Dict[str, Any]
            max_tokens: int - Max response tokens (verbosity check)
            must_include: List[str] - Substrings that MUST appear in response
            must_not_include: List[str] - Substrings that MUST NOT appear
            must_ask_for: List[str] - Questions/prompts that should appear

    Grounding:
        grounding_required: List[str]
            Human-readable descriptions of facts that must be grounded.

        min_grounded_ratio: float
            Minimum grounded span ratio (0.0-1.0, default: 0.0).

    Performance:
        max_latency_ms: int
            Maximum allowed E2E latency in milliseconds.

    Example YAML
    ------------
    ```yaml

      - turn_id: turn_1
        user_input: "Check my account balance"

          tools_called:
            - verify_client_identity
            - get_account_balance
          tools_forbidden:
            - transfer_funds
          handoff:
            to_agent: AccountAgent
          response_constraints:
            max_tokens: 100
            must_include:
              - "balance"
              - "$"
            must_not_include:
              - "error"
          min_grounded_ratio: 0.7
          max_latency_ms: 5000
